## About

`openssl_provider_forge` is a Rust crate which
contains FFI (Foreign Function Interface) bindings
for `OpenSSL 3.2+`,
specifically for its `Core` and `Provider` API.

This is different from the [`rust-openssl`][crates:rust-openssl] crate,
which provides OpenSSL bindings for Rust applications.

In this crate, instead, we define constants and types
useful to author [OpenSSL Providers][ossl:man:provider]
written in Rust.
The goal of this crate is to facilitate
interactions with [OpenSSL Core][ossl:man:core],
without a need to actually link or depend on a specific
OpenSSL binary.

Particularly these abstractions cover:

- [`openssl-core`][ossl:man:core]
- [`openssl-provider-base`][ossl:man:provider-base]

(and their dependencies).

[ossl:man:provider]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.2/man7/provider/
[ossl:man:provider-base]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.2/man7/provider-base/
[ossl:man:core]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.2/man7/openssl-core.h/
[crates:rust-openssl]: https://crates.io/crates/openssl

> [!NOTE]
> **Note on naming conventions**
>
> The name of the repository follows `Github` conventions,
> while the name of the corresponding crate
> follows `crates.io` conventions,
> so the former is `openssl-provider-forge-rs`
> while the latter is `openssl_provider_forge`.
